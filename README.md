This repository contains instructions and assets for hands-on exercises in the Microsoft Official Courseware to support the [Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Engineer Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/certifications/azure-data-engineer/) certification. The exercises are designed to complement the associated training modules on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/training), and a <u>subset</u> of these exercises comprises the hands-on labs in the official [DP-203T00: Data Engineering on Microsoft Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/courses/dp-203t00) instructor-led training course.

## Exercise design principles

The exercises in the repo are designed to support <u>both</u> self-paced learners on Microsoft Learn, and students in official instructor-led training deliveries. In most cases, self-paced learners must provide their own cloud subscription, while students attending official instructor-led courses are typically provided with subscriptions they can use to complete each individual exercise that is included in the course. Note that Microsoft does not support instructor-led deliveries of the exercises in this repo in environments other than those provided by Microsoft authorized lab hosters (ALHs).
